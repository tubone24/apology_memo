Write your apologies and achieve success!

## How about "Apology Memo"

It's hard to keep up with something every day.
The purpose of this app is to help you keep doing something by setting yourself up for the very painful and humiliating task of writing a reflection when you have a hard time keeping up with something every day, or when you can't keep up with it every day.

We've eliminated all unnecessary UI so that you can focus on writing your reflections.

We hope it helps you to keep doing something you're not good at every day.
